            <p>The pet market is an ever-growing market in India and is swamped by pet stores, animal shelters, pet breeders, etc. Many Indians are plagued with the thought of owning only pedigree cats/pure-bred cats for their physical appearance. This demand for pedigree cats has offered itself as a business opportunity for most, which has led to the growth of numerous illegal cat breeders.</p>

            <p>Since the pet owners will be willing to pay a hefty price for purebreds, which are usually expensive, the illegal markets have been thriving on profits. This Indian pet market is an unregulated and unorganized sector. Hence, pet animalsâ€™ lives have always been at risk</p>

            <p>Yes, cat-breeding can be ethical, but only if it is performed by a licensed breeder for research purposes. An ethical breeder will have the sole intention of improving the breed rather than profiting from it.

                Illegal breeding takes place when pure-bred/pedigree cats are forced to breed in very dire situations, which results in a plethora of health problems. Illegal cat breeding is done to get the desired physical appearance of a pedigree cat, and not for the betterment of the cat or the breed.</p>
